# Test Adapter for Boost.Test

## Introduction
The Test Adapter for Boost.Test is a fork by Microsoft of the existing Boost Unit Test Adapter Visual Studio extension by ETAS GmbH, supporting Visual Studio 2017. The adapter automatically discovers unit tests and enables IDE tools to run and manage the tests, see test execution results, and for VS Enterprise users, check code coverage. The original project (supporting Visual Studio 2015) can be found at: [https://github.com/etas/vs-boost-unit-test-adapter](https://github.com/etas/vs-boost-unit-test-adapter).
